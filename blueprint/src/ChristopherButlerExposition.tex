The general linear group of degree $n$ is the group formed by the set of $n$ x $n$ invertible matrices, together with the operation of ordinary matrix multiplication, with the entries of each matrix coming from a specific ring or field. The special linear group is a subgroup of the general linear group, namely those matrices with a deteminant equal to 1. In this work, we focus on the two-dimensional case, with entries coming from an algebraically closed field, $F$. This is denoted by $GL(2,F)$ for the general linear group and $SL(2,F)$ for the special linear group. Recall that an algebraically closed field is a field which contains the roots to any non-constant polynomial in $F[x]$, with coefficients in $F$. They are infinite in size and two such examples are the field of complex numbers and the field of algebraic numbers. \\

In 1901, Leonard Eugene Dickson published his book \textit{Linear Groups, with an Exposition of the Galois Field Theory} \cite{dickson}. In this work, he obtains a complete classification of the finite subgroups of $SL(2,F)$. This paper is a reformulation of Dickson's classification theorem and loosely follows Chapter 3, $\mathsection$6 in Michio Suzuki’s book \textit{Group Theory I} \cite{suzuki}. This classification theorem is of particular interest in the study of finite simple groups and Suzuki himself describes it as \textit{one of the indispensable tools in studying the basic properties of linear groups which underlie the concept of $p$-stability} \cite[p.392]{suzuki}. \\

The paper begins with a brief overview of some preliminary requirements which are necessary to the understanding of the proof. They are standard group theory results which may or may not have been covered in a first course given on group theory, the majority of which are cited without proof. A more advanced reader may choose to skip over this chapter. \\

The main body of work begins in Chapter 1 and focuses on the infinite group $SL(2,F)$. We make some important observations about the conjugacy of the elements in this group and the centre of the group. Some important elements and subgroups of $SL(2,F)$ are defined and their centralisers and normalisers determined. We show that the action of $SL(2,F)$ on the projective line is triply transitive, which is a vital tool used several times throughout the paper in determining group structure. \\

\\
In Chapter 2 we consider an arbitrary finite subgroup $G$ of $SL(2,F)$. The notion of a \textit{maximal abelian subgroup} is introduced and utilised to construct a class equation, whereby $G$ is partitioned into the conjugacy classes of it's maximal abelian subgroups. This plays a crucial role in determining the possible structures of $G$. We find that the number and type of these conjugacy classes are restricted to just 6 different cases. \\
\vspace{-0.2mm}
\\
The final chapter examines these 6 cases individually. In each case we determine the possible structures that $G$ could have. The 10 possible structures of $G$ are finally consolidated into the classification theorem.
