\section{What is the formalisation of mathematics?}

formalisation of mathematics is the art of teaching a computer what a piece of mathematics means.

That is, it is the process of carefully writing down a mathematical statement typically in first order logic or higher order logic and then scrutinously justifying each step of the proof to a computer program that checks the validity of every step of the reasoning. 

Typically one formalizes mathematics with the help of a proof assistant or interactive theorem prover, a piece of software which enables a human to write down mathematics and have the software verify the claims.

There exist many proof assistants, such examples are Lean, Isabelle, Coq, Metamath, etc.

For this project I have opted to use Lean due to its rapid growing mathematics library and its dependent type theory. I shall explain in more detail these last two reasons, but first I will comment on what Lean is.

\subsubsection{What is Lean?}

Lean is both a functional programming language and an interactive theorem prover that is being developed at Microsoft research and AWS by Leonardo de Moura and his team.
It has been designed for both use in cutting-edge mathematics and the verification of software which is often essential to safety critical systems where correctness is of extreme

\section{Fermat's Last Theorem}


\subsubsection{Problem statement and its history}
Fermat's Last Theorem, before it was proved that is, A conjecture about the \textit{Fermat equation} which is defined to be

\begin{definition}[Fermat Equation]
    The equation $a^n + b^n = c^n$ is Fermat's Equation
\end{definition}

When $a, b, c$ and $n$ in this equation are restricted to positive integers, we are defining a particular family of what are called \textit{Diophantine equation}.
Diophantus, an ancient greek mathematician was interested in positive integers which satisfy this equation. For instance, a particular set of numbers which satisfy this equation 
are the \textit{Pythagorean triples}, such triples have been known since Babylonian times. For example, when we substitute the Pythagorean triple $(a,b,c) = (3,4,5)$ and set $n = 2$ we find that 
indeed Fermat's equation holds for this choice of numbers since:

\[
3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
\]

In fact, much is known about the case when $n = 2$; it is known that all Pythagorean triples are of the form:

\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean triples]
    All pythagorean triples are of the form:

    \[
    a = r \cdot (s^2 - t^2), \qquad b = r \cdot (2st) = r \cdot (s^2 + t^2)
    \]
\end{theorem}

The natural question to ask from such an extremely satisfying theorem is whether the same can be said for when $n \ge 2$. Initially, mathematicians set out to
to find solutions $n = 3$. However, it seemed only the "trivial" triple satsfied Fermat's equation for when $n = 2$

\[
0^3 + 1^3 = 1^3
\]

Among these mathematicians was Pierre de Fermat, who suspected it was not possible to find a nontrivial triple for the exponent $n= 3$ and what is more he believed
it was not possible to find any nontrivial triple for any exponent $n > 2$. In fact, Pierre de Fermat wrote in the margin of his copy of \textit{Arithmetic} written by Diophantus:
"
It is impossible... for any number which is a power greater than the second to be written as the sum of two like powers 
\[ 
x^n + y^n = z^n \text{ for } n > 2.
\]
I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.
"

This copy and many of Pierre de Fermat's belongings were searched in the hope of finding such a proof. Nonetheless, to this date no proof has been found.


It took Euler to provide a (flawed) proof for the nonexistence of nontrivial solutions to Fermat's equation for the exponent $n = 3$, so far so good, Fermat's conjecture held true for $n = 3$.
The case where $n = 4$ was also proved by Euler; soon enough particular cases where $n$ was some fixed natural number where being shown, which indeed seemed to suggest Fermat's conjecture was true.
However, no approach seemed to generalise to prove the general case...

% Kummer, Lame, Wiles

%Fermat's conjecture was shown to be true for particular values of $n > 2$.

The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is the culmination of the effort of mathematicians spanning generations.

From Diophantus, the first known person to systematically study what we now call \textit{Diophantine equations}, to Fermat developing the elementary theory of number theory and then due to the invaluable work of countless mathematicians 
around the world which built upon each other's work a list of such mathematicians contains the names of: Gauss, Galois, Euler, Abel, Dedekind, Noether, Euler, Kummer, Mazur, Kronecker, etc.



\section{Formalizing Fermat's Last Theorem}

Following the sequence of success stories ranging from the Liquid Tensor Experiment to the formalisation of the Polynomial Freiman-Rusza conjecture. 

Prof. Kevin Buzzard from Imperial College London has received a five-year grant that will allow him to lead the formalisation of Fermat's Last Theorem. This grant kicked in in October of 2024. 

At the time of writing, since October of 2024, a digital blueprint has been set up to manage the project.

Alongside other infrastructure like the project dashboard, mathematicians around the world can claim tasks that are set by Prof. Kevin Buzzard and if in return a task is returned with a "sorry" free proof then one can claim the glory of having completed the task.

\subsubsection{The first target of the formalisation of Fermat's Last Theorem}

The goal of the ongoing efforts of the formalisation is to reduce the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem to results that were known in the 1980s such as \text{Mazur's Theorem}.

However, it should be mentioned that the proof being formalised is not the proof Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor initially came up with during 1994, but a more modernised approach that has been refined over the last 20 years.

At the time of writing, the first target set by Prof. Kevin Buzzard is to formalise the \textbf{Modularity Lifting Theorem}
% https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/FLT/blueprint/ch_overview.html#a0000000021
% , which states:

% \begin{theorem}

% \end{theorem}

After all, the ultimate goal is to formalise all of mathematics and so far the library relevant to Algebraic Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Geometry is not developed enough
to be even able to state the propositions and let alone formalise their corresponding proofs.

Morally, the goal of the formalisation of Fermat's Last Theorem is to formalise much of Algebraic Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Arithmetic Geometry and so forth so that one day
the mathematics library of Lean \texttt{mathlib}, contains all mathematics known to human kind.



\section{Classification of finite subgroups of the $\PGL_2(\Fbar_p)$ within Fermat's Last Theorem}

The primary concern of this project is to formalise Theorem 2.47 of \cite{dtt} which states:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $H$ is finite subgroup of $\PGL_2(\C)$ then $H$ is isomorphic to one of the following groups: the cyclic group $C_n$ of order $n$ ($n \in \Z_{>0}$), the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ of order $2n$ ($n \in \Z_{>1}$), $A_4$, $S_4$ or $A_5$.
\item If $H$ is a finite subgroup of $\PGL_2(\Fbar_\ell)$ then one of the following holds:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $H$ is conjugate to a subgroup of the upper triangular matrices;
    \item $H$ is conjugate to $\PGL_2(\F_{\ell^r})$ and $\PSL_2(\F_{\ell^{r}})$ for some $r \in \Z_{>0}$;
    \item $H$ is isomorphic to $A_4$, $S_4$, $A_5$ or the dihedral group $D_{2r}$ of order $2r$ for some $r \in \Z_{>1}$ not divisible by $\ell$

\end{enumerate}
    Where $\ell$ is assumed to be an odd prime.
\end{enumerate}

Recall that the Projective General Linear Group is defined to be:

\begin{definition}[Projective general linear group]
    The projective general linear group is the quotient group
    \[    
    \PGL_n(F) = \GL_n(F) / (Z(\GL_n(F))) = \GL_n(F) / (F^\times I) 
    \]
\end{definition}

Similarly, the Projective Special Linear Group is defined to be:

\begin{lemma}[Projective special linear group]
    \[
    \PSL_n(F) = \SL_n(F) / (Z(\SL_n(F))) = \SL_n(F) / (\langle -I\rangle)
    \]
\end{lemma}

At first glance, neither the statement or the definitions seem to indicate how the classification of finite subgroups of $\PGL_2(\Fbar_p)$ play a role in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, after all, Fermat's Last Theorem is a statement
regarding natural numbers. 

Upon inspection of the proof it turns out that Theorem 2.47 of \cite{dtt} is required is for Theorem 2.49, Remark 2.47 and Lemma 4.11. Where in particular, Theorem 2.49 is a key component in Theorem 3.42 which states that:

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 3.42]
    For all finite sets $\Sigma \subset \Sigma_{\bar{\rho}}$, the map $\phi_\Sigma : R_\Sigma \rightarrow \mathbb{T}_\Sigma$ is an isomorphism and these rings are complete intersections,
\end{theorem}

There is of course a lot of notation to hidden within these statement, yet unpacking and understanding in detail the following two theorems is not at all the concern for this project. 
Naturally, the reference \cite{dtt} would be the indicated source to truly understand what these statements claim and how they fit together in the big picture of proving Fermat's Last Theorem; but for completeness,
very loosely the key idea is that the two key players:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The local ring $R_\Sigma$ which is called the universal deformation ring for representations of type $\Sigma$.
    where $\Sigma_{\bar{\rho}}$ is the set of primes $p$ satisfying
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $p = \ell$ and $\bar{\rho}|_G_{\ell}$ is good and ordinary; or
        \item $p \ne \ell$ and $\bar{\rho}$ is unramified at $p$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The ring $\mathbb{T}_\Sigma$ is a Hecke algebra, defined as a subalgebra of the linear endomorphisms of a certain space of automorphic forms.
\end{enumerate}

TODO - explain why this isomorphism is crucial.


Moreover, the statement of Theorem 2.49 is the following:

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 2.49]
    Suppose $L = \Q(\sqrt{(-1)^{\ell -1}/2} \ell)$ then $\bar{\rho}$ is absolutely irreducible. Then
    there exists a non-negative integer $r$ such that for any $n \in \Z_{>0}$ we can find a
    finite set of primes $Q_n$ with the following properties.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $q \in Q_n$ then $q \equiv 1 \mod n$.
        \item If $q \in Q_n$ then $\bar{\rho}$ is unramified at $q$ and $\rho(\textrm{Frob}q)$ has distinct eigenvalues.
        \item $\# Q_n = r$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The place where the theorem 2.47 is of interest, the theorem that this project aims to be a blueprint for, is because proving proving the claim above requires showing that the 
cohomology group  $H^1(\Gal(F_n / F_0. \textrm{ad}^0\bar{\rho}(1)))^G_\Q$ is trivial, which in turn reduces to showing that $\ell$, an odd prime, does not divide the Galois group $\Gal(F_0 /\Q)$ which is isomorphic to a finite subgroup $\PGL_2(\Fbar_\ell)$
and has $\Gal(\Q(\zeta_\ell/\Q))$ as a quotient.

Provided the classification of finite subgroups of $\PGL_2(\Fbar_\ell)$, it suffices to prove that the cohomology group is trivial for the case where $\ell = 3$.

This explains in a very vauge fashion why the classification of finite subgroups of $\PGL_2(\Fbar)$ is relevant to proving Fermat's Last Theorem.

% Since we have that for an odd prime $\ell > 3$ we have that $\ell$ does not divide the orders of the finite subgroups of $\PGL_2(\Fbar_\ell)$ as the finite subgroups can only have the order of the finit subgroups they are isomorphic to which
% are: $|A_4| = 4! / 2$, $|S_5| = 5 !$, $|A_5| = 5! / 2 $,  $|\PSL_2(k)| = \ell^k(\ell^{2k} - 1)$ or $|\PGL_2(k)| = (\ell^2 -1)(q^2 - q)$.



%     where furthermore, $\bar{\rho} : G_\Q \rightarrow \GL_2(k)$ is a continuous representation with the following properties
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item $\bar{\rho}$ is irreducible,
%         \item $\bar{\rho}$ is modular,
%         \item $\det \bar{\rho} = \epsilon$,
%         \item $\bar{\rho}\_G_{\ell}$ is semi-stable,
%         \item and if $p \ne \ell$ then $\#\bar{\rho}(I_p) | \ell$.
%     \end{enumerate} 

%     Additionally, $\mathbb{T}_\Sigma$ is the 


% However, the projective general linear group can be viewed under a different light when it is considered alongside projective space $\mathbb{P}^n = \mathbb{A}^n / \sim$ where

\section{Overview and reduction to the classification problem}

Returning to the domain of the problem of interest, classifying finite subgroups of $\PGL_2(\Fbar_p)$.

Observing that $\Fbar_p$ is by construction an algebraically closed field, since it is the algebraic closure of $\F_p$; it turns out that for any $n \in \N$, we can show that $\PGL_n(F)$ is isomorphic to $\PSL_n(F)$
and thus we only need consider finite subgroups of $\PSL_2(\Fbar)$.

Furthermore, on the back of the isomorphism defined between $\PGL_2(\Fbar_p)$ and $\PSL_2(\Fbar_p)$, and determining that the center $Z(\SL_2(\Fbar_p)) = \langle -I\rangle$, we can in fact focus on the much more tractable problem of 
classifying the finite subgroups of $SL_2(\Fbar_p)$ to eventually classify the finite subgroups of $\PGL_2(\Fbar_p)$. Moreover, since the more general problem of classifying the finite subgroups of $\SL_2(F)$ where $F$ is an arbitrary algebraically closed field
yields a statement very close to the desired statement and Christopher Butler has a in-depth exposition of this result, the formalisation of slightly more general result was chosen.

Considering proving the existence of such an isomorphism $\PGL_2(\Fbar_p)$ and $\PSL_2(\Fbar_p)$ is no more difficult in the general case, the goal of the next chapter will be to formalise the definition of a suitable homomorphism between $\PGL_n(F)$ and $\PSL_n(F)$, where $F$ is an algebraically closed field, 
and formally prove in the Lean proof assistant that this homomorphism actually defines an isomorphism.
