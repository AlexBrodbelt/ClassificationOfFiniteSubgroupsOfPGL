<h1 id="Ch2_Introduction">2 Introduction</h1>

<h1 id="a0000000015">2.1 What is the formalisation of mathematics?</h1>
<p>formalisation of mathematics is the art of teaching a computer what a piece of mathematics means. </p>
<p>That is, it is the process of carefully writing down a mathematical statement typically in first order logic or higher order logic and then scrutinously justifying each step of the proof to a computer program that checks the validity of every step of the reasoning. </p>
<p>Typically one formalizes mathematics with the help of a proof assistant or interactive theorem prover, a piece of software which enables a human to write down mathematics and have the software verify the claims. </p>
<p>There exist many proof assistants, such examples are Lean, Isabelle, Coq, Metamath, etc. </p>
<p>For this project I have opted to use Lean due to its rapid growing mathematics library and its dependent type theory. I shall explain in more detail these last two reasons, but first I will comment on what Lean is. </p>
<h3 id="a0000000016">What is Lean?</h3>
<p>Lean is both a functional programming language and an interactive theorem prover (also known as a proof assistant) that is being developed at Microsoft research and AWS by Leonardo de Moura and his team. It has been designed for both use in cutting-edge mathematics and the verification of software which is often essential to safety critical systems such as medical or aviation software, where any error can have catastrophic consequences on people’s lives or infrastructure. </p>
<p>Theorem provers like Lean harness the tight bond between proofs and programs. Often an algorithm, say like the euclidean algorithm, is used for the proof for why it is possible within a euclidean domain \(R\), that is to say, a ring \(R\) with a euclidean function \(\nu : R \setminus \{ 0\}  \rightarrow \mathbb {Z}_{\geq 0}\) which satisfies that for all \(x, y \in R\) with \(y \ne 0\), there exist \(q, r \in \mathbb {R}\) such that \(a = qb + r\) where either \(r = 0\) or \(\nu (r) {\lt} \nu (b)\); it is possible for any \(r,s \in R\) to find a unique linear combination which is the greatest common divisor of \(r\) and \(s\), that is, there exist unique coefficients \(a, b \in R\) such that \(ar + bs = \gcd (r, s)\). </p>
<p>It is not always clear how a proof corresponds to a program, but this correspondence does exist nonetheless, and it is known as the <b class="bfseries">Curry-Howard correspondence</b> where formulas correspond to <i class="itshape">types</i>, which correspond to the notion of a specification, proofs for formulas correspond to constructing a term of the corresponding type and so forth. In fact it turns out that for every logic, such as classical or intuitionistic logic, there corresponds a type system which express the valid rules for programs. For our purposes, we will not provide a deep overview of this fundamental correspondence, but rather we will illustrate the core principle with a suitable example. </p>

  <p> The equation \(a^n + b^n = c^n\) is Fermat’s Equation </p>

  </div>
</div>
<p>When \(a, b, c\) and \(n\) in this equation are restricted to positive integers, we are defining a particular family of what are called <i class="itshape">Diophantine equation</i>. Diophantus, an ancient greek mathematician was interested in positive integers which satisfy this equation. For instance, a particular set of numbers which satisfy this equation are the <i class="itshape">Pythagorean triples</i>, such triples have been known since Babylonian times. For example, when we substitute the Pythagorean triple \((a,b,c) = (3,4,5)\) and set \(n = 2\) we find that indeed Fermat’s equation holds for this choice of numbers since: </p>
<div class="displaymath" id="a0000000054">
  \[  3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2  \]
</div>
<p>In fact, much is known about the case when \(n = 2\); it is known that all Pythagorean triples are of the form: </p>

  \[  a = r \cdot (s^2 - t^2), \qquad b = r \cdot (2st) = r \cdot (s^2 + t^2)  \]
</div>

  </div>
</div>
<p>The natural question to ask from such an extremely satisfying theorem is whether the same can be said for when \(n \ge 2\). Initially, mathematicians set out to to find solutions \(n = 3\). However, it seemed only the "trivial" triple satsfied Fermat’s equation for when \(n = 2\) </p>
<div class="displaymath" id="a0000000057">
  \[  0^3 + 1^3 = 1^3  \]
</div>
<p>Among these mathematicians was Pierre de Fermat, who suspected it was not possible to find a nontrivial triple for the exponent \(n= 3\) and what is more he believed it was not possible to find any nontrivial triple for any exponent \(n {\gt} 2\). In fact, Pierre de Fermat wrote in the margin of his copy of <i class="itshape">Arithmetic</i> written by Diophantus: " It is impossible... for any number which is a power greater than the second to be written as the sum of two like powers </p>
<div class="displaymath" id="a0000000058">
  \[  x^n + y^n = z^n \text{ for } n {\gt} 2.  \]
</div>
<p> I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain. " </p>
<p>This copy and many of Pierre de Fermat’s belongings were searched in the hope of finding such a proof. Nonetheless, to this date no proof has been found. </p>
<p>It took Euler to provide a (flawed) proof for the nonexistence of nontrivial solutions to Fermat’s equation for the exponent \(n = 3\), so far so good, Fermat’s conjecture held true for \(n = 3\). The case where \(n = 4\) was also proved by Euler; soon enough particular cases where \(n\) was some fixed natural number where being shown, which indeed seemed to suggest Fermat’s conjecture was true. However, no approach seemed to generalise to prove the general case... </p>
<p>TODO - link paragraphs and clean up </p>
<p>The proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem is the culmination of the effort of mathematicians spanning generations. </p>
<p>From Diophantus, the first known person to systematically study what we now call <i class="itshape">Diophantine equations</i>, to Fermat developing the elementary theory of number theory and then due to the invaluable work of countless mathematicians around the world which built upon each other’s work a list of such mathematicians contains the names of: Gauss, Galois, Euler, Abel, Dedekind, Noether, Euler, Kummer, Mazur, Kronecker, etc. </p>
<h1 id="a0000000019">2.3 Formalizing Fermat’s Last Theorem</h1>
<p>Following the sequence of success stories ranging from the Liquid Tensor Experiment to the formalisation of the Polynomial Freiman-Rusza conjecture. </p>
<p>Prof. Kevin Buzzard from Imperial College London has received a five-year grant that will allow him to lead the formalisation of Fermat’s Last Theorem. This grant kicked in in October of 2024. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, since October of 2024, a digital blueprint has been set up to manage the project. </p>

<p>The goal of the ongoing efforts of the formalisation is to reduce the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem to results that were known in the 1980s such as Mazur’s Theorem. </p>
<p>However, it should be mentioned that the proof being formalised is not the proof Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor initially came up with during 1994, but a more modernised approach that has been refined over the last 20 years. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, the first target set by Prof. Kevin Buzzard is to formalise the <b class="bfseries">Modularity Lifting Theorem</b> </p>
<p>After all, the ultimate goal is to formalise all of mathematics and so far the library relevant to Algebraic Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Geometry is not developed enough to be even able to state the propositions and let alone formalise their corresponding proofs. </p>
<p>Morally, the goal of the formalisation of Fermat’s Last Theorem is to formalise much of Algebraic Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Arithmetic Geometry and so forth so that one day the mathematics library of Lean <span class="ttfamily">mathlib</span>, contains all mathematics known to human kind. </p>

<p>At first glance, neither the statement or the definitions seem to indicate how the classification of finite subgroups of \(\operatorname{PGL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_p)\) play a role in the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, after all, Fermat’s Last Theorem is a statement regarding natural numbers. </p>
<p>Upon inspection of the proof it turns out that Theorem 2.47 of <span class="cite">
	[

<p>The place where the theorem 2.47 is of interest, the theorem that this project aims to be a blueprint for, is because proving proving the claim above requires showing that the cohomology group \(H^1(\operatorname{Gal}(F_n / F_0. \textrm{ad}^0\bar{\rho }(1)))^G_\mathbb {Q}\) is trivial, which in turn reduces to showing that \(\ell \), an odd prime, does not divide the Galois group \(\operatorname{Gal}(F_0 /\mathbb {Q})\) which is isomorphic to a finite subgroup \(\operatorname{PGL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_\ell )\) and has \(\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb {Q}(\zeta _\ell /\mathbb {Q}))\) as a quotient. </p>
<p>Provided the classification of finite subgroups of \(\operatorname{PGL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_\ell )\), it suffices to prove that the cohomology group is trivial for the case where \(\ell = 3\). </p>
<p>This explains in a very vauge fashion why the classification of finite subgroups of \(\operatorname{PGL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}})\) is relevant to proving Fermat’s Last Theorem. </p>
<h1 id="a0000000022">2.5 Overview and reduction to the classification problem</h1>
<p>Returning to the domain of the problem of interest, classifying finite subgroups of \(\operatorname{PGL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_p)\). </p>
<p>Observing that \(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_p\) is by construction an algebraically closed field, since it is the algebraic closure of \(\mathbb {F}_p\); it turns out that for any \(n \in \mathbb {N}\), we can show that \(\operatorname{PGL}_n(F)\) is isomorphic to \(\operatorname{PSL}_n(F)\) and thus we only need consider finite subgroups of \(\operatorname{PSL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}})\). </p>
<p>Furthermore, on the back of the isomorphism defined between \(\operatorname{PGL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_p)\) and \(\operatorname{PSL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_p)\), and determining that the center \(Z(\operatorname{SL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_p)) = \langle -I\rangle \), we can in fact focus on the much more tractable problem of classifying the finite subgroups of \(SL_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_p)\) to eventually classify the finite subgroups of \(\operatorname{PGL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_p)\). Moreover, since the more general problem of classifying the finite subgroups of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(F)\) where \(F\) is an arbitrary algebraically closed field yields a statement very close to the desired statement and Christopher Butler has a in-depth exposition of this result, the formalisation of slightly more general result was chosen. </p>
<p>Considering proving the existence of such an isomorphism \(\operatorname{PGL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_p)\) and \(\operatorname{PSL}_2(\bar{\mathbb {F}}_p)\) is no more difficult in the general case, the goal of the next chapter will be to formalise the definition of a suitable homomorphism between \(\operatorname{PGL}_n(F)\) and \(\operatorname{PSL}_n(F)\), where \(F\) is an algebraically closed field, and formally prove in the Lean proof assistant that this homomorphism actually defines an isomorphism. </p>
